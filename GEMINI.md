## Development Conventions

Based on the initial exploration, no explicit development conventions (e.g., coding style guides, specific testing frameworks beyond `com.unity.test-framework`) are immediately apparent. It is recommended to follow standard Unity development practices and C# coding conventions. Existing scripts, if any, should be used as a guide for style and structure.
